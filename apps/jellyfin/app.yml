description: Free media server. Stream movies, TV shows, music, and photos to any device with hardware-accelerated transcoding.
overview: |
  Jellyfin is the free software media system that puts you in control of managing and streaming your digital media. It is a fully open-source alternative to proprietary media servers like Plex and Emby, with no premium tiers or tracking.

  It automatically organizes your movies, TV shows, music, and photos with rich metadata from online databases. Clients are available for virtually every platform including web browsers, Android, iOS, Roku, Fire TV, and Kodi.

  Hardware-accelerated transcoding via Intel QSV or NVIDIA NVENC lets Jellyfin transcode media on-the-fly for devices that can't play the original format, without taxing the CPU. After installation, complete the setup wizard at the web UI to add your media libraries.
